This project applies Facebook Prophet to forecast yearly tourist arrivals in the United Kingdom using the World Bank’s international tourism dataset (via Kaggle). The workflow includes data cleaning, transforming the dataset from wide to long format, preparing Prophet-compatible date and value fields, training a forecasting model, and visualizing both the historical data and future predictions. The project demonstrates an end-to-end time series forecasting pipeline using Python, Pandas, Prophet, and Matplotlib, resulting in clear insights about long-term trends and future tourism patterns.
